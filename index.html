							<h2>Professional Development Experience</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Embarking on my journey as a software engineer at Dish Network has been a dynamic exploration</strong>, offering manifold opportunities to broaden my skill set. Initially tasked with troubleshooting front-end bugs reported by customers, I swiftly immersed myself in the workflow and development environment. Recognizing avenues for improvement, I proactively introduced automation scripts, catching the eye of my manager due to the heightened efficiency.
							Promptly, I found myself collaborating with a team of DevOps engineers, crafting internal software to empower our colleagues in their development endeavors. In the realm of Kotlin, we innovatively enhanced the toolset, providing engineers with features that not only amplified productivity but also offered valuable insights into the performance of their software on set-top boxes. It's been an exhilarating journey of learning and contributing to transformative solutions.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Having successfully implemented tools such as a graphical memory tracker and a software installer for our cutting-edge Android TV devices,</strong> I sought out fresh challenges. Requesting a move to a team focused on the critical software responsible for communication between our devices and remote controls, I now collaborate closely with the hardware team and customer service department.
							Together, our goal is to exceed customer expectations while continuously enhancing the user experience and proactively addressing issues for our customer service team. 
							Serving as the primary interface between users and the set-top box functions, our team operates under the recognition that most issues are attributed to the remote control, 
							regardless of the actual source of malfunction. This necessitates our responsiveness and precision in addressing concerns. Our recent focus involves transitioning functionality to a background application, effectively isolating communication with our transceiver from the broader suite of Dish applications on our new line of Android TV devices. Amid this transition, we prioritize development with a dual lens on performance and security, ensuring seamless data exchange between the set-top box and the remote control.

							<h2>Academic Development Projects</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>My education in development</strong> was mainly back end focused. Working closely with the other computer engineers at Texas A&M, I spent a lot of time working on systems running Linux, working in C++ on projects like building a custom shell and a custom memory allocator.</p>

									<header>
										<h3>Streamful</h3>
										<p class="sidebar">Streamful is a site that I designed and built with a team of three other members. It allows users to access live streams from all the top live streaming services in one convenient place. The project was centered around incorporating APIs into a hosted site. A secondary objective was to include accessibility functions. We built this using the Django web framework.</p>
										<p class="sidebar">Django was completely new to everyone on the team so the challenges began right away. As we learned the ins and outs of the framework, we implemented the APIs and tracked user profiles in the Model Template View architecture. Tuning of the calls to each API became important as we ran testing, so as to remain within our API quotas.</p>

							<h2>Fabrication Projects</h2>

						<div class="content">
						<p><strong>As a professional fabricator</strong> I worked at every level of the custom fabrication process. The shop valued versatility; I did client intake, project design, project management, CAD/CAM, sculpting, painting, fabrication or installation and any combination of the above. Here are just a few projects that I worked on.</p>

Electrical, kinetic and functional elements were a big part of making clients visions become reality. Shiner uses this piece at festivals as seen here at Fun Fun Fun Fest.</p>

A special hardcoat was added to the outside of the sculptures so the critters had some give. A life like paint scheme was added to finish.</p>

										<h3>Johnson and Johnson Meeting Room</h3>
										<p class="sidebar">One of the largest projects that I worked on was this fiberglass meeting room made for the entry of the Johnson and Johnson lab in Houston. Managing this project was a challenge with a timeline that took the better part of a year. We fabbed the panels and covered them in fiberglass and resin, recoating and sanding until we got the perfect contours. We arranged the panels in a mocked-up room in our shop in Austin to ensure smooth fit between panels. We then painted the panels in the shop individually before driving them to Houston. There I led a team to set the panels up, seam the panels with fiberglass on site, and finally shoot the seams and buff it out to a perfectly smooth finish.</p>

										<h3>The Lucky Cat</h3>
										<p class="sidebar">We worked on two sculptures that were for ramen restaurants in Texas. This one resides in Houston and a its sister is in Austin. I modeled a general shape for the cat in Rhino3D. Then I milled the blocks, assembled and sculpted the final shape. After hardcoating the object, I installed the whisker sockets. Finally, I primed the cat before passing it off for final paint and install.</p>

										<h3>Nessy</h3>
										<p class="sidebar">Nessy is a sea monster that popped up in the park near the Thinkery kids' museum in Austin. We fabbed the armature and sculpted the body around it. Covering the form in glass fiber reinforced concrete, we got Nessy ready for mosaic. My brother and I ran the installation on site, working with some amazing crane operators.</p>
